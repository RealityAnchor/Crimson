info - Bounds/info are ignored by ui.py right now. I will probably remove bounds, I don't see myself changing the 30x30 grid.
info - Any line starting with "room" will be drawn onto the play area.
info - The first two numbers describe the location of the upper left square of the room
info - The last two numbers describe the location of the bottom right square of the room
info - Feel free to make your own rooms and test them out!
